# Space-Invaders

I created this repository to recreate one of my favorite games, Space Invader. I was inspired by the original Space Invaders that was released for the Atari 2600 in 1978. After realizing that the PCB in the cartridge might fail because of age, I decided to write my own Space Invaders in Python with PyGame. This is a perfect way to grow as a game developer, learn how games are developed, and to perserve games from the past. 

Enjoy!
